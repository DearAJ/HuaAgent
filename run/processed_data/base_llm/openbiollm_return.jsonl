Engaging in hormone-based sex or using hormone creams or gels may slightly increase the chance of cancer coming back. It's important to discuss these potential risks with your doctor and make an informed decision about your personal health.  The Answer is: Yes, it can affect breast cancer recurrence risk.", "retrieved_contexts": "目前没有证据表明乳腺癌病人正常的、适度的性生活会影响复发风险。因为肿瘤疾病不是传染病，所以不会通过性生活而传染给对方。当然，在治疗期间及处于虚弱状态下的病人是不宜进行性生活的。性能力的恢复，从另一方面也反映了整个机体的恢复。"}
{"user_input": "乳腺癌化疗的新进展属于哪种类型？", "response": "The latest advancements in chemotherapy for breast cancer can be classified into several types, including: 1. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and epirubicin (Ellence). These drugs work by inhibiting DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells, which includes cancer cells. 2. Taxanes, like paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel (Taxotere), and nab-paclitaxel. Taxanes interfere with cell division and prevent the formation of microtubules, thus inhibiting cancer cell growth. 3. Platinum compounds, including cisplatin (Platinol) and carboplatin (Paraplat). These drugs form adducts to DNA, causing DNA-PK-mediated intra-S phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis of rapidly dividing cells. 4. Anthraquinones, such as mitoxantrone (Dacarbazine), which work by disrupting DNA replication. 5. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolite drug that interferes with RNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. 6. Vinorelbine (Navelbine) is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid that prevents microtubule formation, leading to inhibition of mitosis and cell division. 7. Capecitabine is an oral fluorouracil prodrug that is converted into its active form in the body to inhibit DNA synthesis. 8. In recent years, targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody against HER2 protein overexpressed", "retrieved_contexts": "乳腺癌化疗的新进展属于疾病型问题，是一种事实型问题。"}
{"user_input": "穿刺良性之后可以不做手术吗？", "response": "As a medical AI assistant, I can provide general information about breast cancer. However, it is important to consult with your doctor for personalized advice regarding your specific condition.  There are several treatment options available for early-stage breast cancer: 1. Surgery: The primary treatment for early-stage breast cancer is often surgery. This may involve either a lumpectomy (removal of the tumor) or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast). Lymph node removal may also be recommended to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue. 2. Radiation therapy: After surgery, radiation therapy may be recommended to destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. 3. Chemotherapy: In some cases, chemotherapy drugs are used before or after surgery to kill cancer cells that cannot be seen or removed by surgical means. 4. Hormone therapy: If your tumor is hormone receptor-positive, medications may be prescribed to block the effects of estrogen on breast cancer cells to prevent further growth.  The decision whether to proceed with surgery depends on various factors such as the size and location of the tumor, lymph node involvement, overall health status", "retrieved_contexts": "对于乳房胂物，一般需要进行穿刺检查以明确是否为恶性病变。如果穿刺结果为良性，通常情况下不需要进行手术治疗，但仍需要定期随访和检查以监测病情。如果穿刺结果为恶性，那么需要根据病情进行手术和其他治疗措施。综上所述，穿刺良性之后是否需要手术，需要根据具体情况而定，建议在医生的指导下进行治疗。"}
{"user_input": "如何治疗乳腺癌？", "response": "The treatment options for breast cancer depend on various factors such as the stage of the cancer, hormone receptor status, age, and overall health of the patient. The main approaches to treating breast cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be recommended. It is important for patients to consult with their oncologist to determine the most appropriate treatment plan tailored to their specific situation.", "retrieved_contexts": "建议根据患者体质强弱、病程长短、肿瘤状况、手术状况、放化疗方案等具体情况来调整治疗方法。通常术后放化疗开始，需要“扶正”与“祛邪”比例为9∶1，放化疗结束，内分泌治疗期间为8∶2。"}
{"user_input": "BI-RADS分类是什么？", "response": "The BI-RADS classification system is used to categorize breast imaging findings into different levels of suspicion for malignancy or other significant conditions. It helps standardize communication between radiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and patients regarding the interpretation of mammograms and other breast imaging studies. The categories range from 0 (incomplete assessment) to 6 (highly suggestive of malignancy), providing a consistent way to report findings and guide further management.", "retrieved_contexts": "BI-RADS（Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System）分类是用于乳腺成像检查报告的系统，旨在标准化乳腺成像结果的表达和解释，便于医生之间的交流和患者的管理。该系统由美国放射学会（American College of Radiology，ACR）制定和推广，现已得到全球广泛应用。_x000D_\nBI-RADS分类将乳腺成像检查结果分为0~6类，具体如下： _x000D_\n0类：需要进一步影像学检查，包括重复乳腺X线摄影、乳腺超声、磁共振等。 _x000D_\n1类：乳房无异常发现，乳腺组织完全正常。 _x000D_\n2类：乳房无明显病变，但存在非病理性改变，如乳房纤维囊性变、脂肪块等。 _x000D_\n3类：乳房存在低度疑似恶性肿块，需要进行定期随访或穿刺检查。 _x000D_\n4类：乳房存在高度疑似恶性肿块，需要进行穿刺或其他治疗。 _x000D_\n5类：乳房成像结果高度提示恶性肿瘤，需要手术治疗。 _x000D_\n6类：乳腺已被确诊为恶性肿瘤。 _x000D_\nBI-RADS分类系统的使用，可以使医生对乳腺成像检查结果进行更为准确和一致的解读和表达，为乳腺疾病的早期发现和治疗提供了重要的支持。"}
