(3 sentences)", "retrieved_contexts": "术后化疗，又称为辅助化疗，从20世纪70年代起就已经越来越广泛地应用于乳腺癌的治疗，并成为乳腺癌综合治疗的重要组成部分。一项始于1998年的大型临床研究对18000名乳腺癌患者进行了长达10年的观察分析发现，不论淋巴结是否有转移，辅助化疗都能改善患者的无病生存率和远期生存率。其中淋巴结阳性的50岁以下和50岁以上患者的10年生存率分别提高17.1%及2.4%。但是对于一些绝经后、肿瘤直径小、淋巴结阴性的患者的研究则显示这些患者不进行辅助治疗仍可达到95%的5年无病生存率。那么怎样的患者需要进行辅助化疗呢？我们知道，在非浸润性乳腺癌，癌细胞一般是不会发生转移的，原则上不存在致命危险，因此没有化疗指征。在局部晚期乳（Ⅲ期）腺癌，患者的预后总体较差，因此术后都应进行辅助化疗。早期（Ⅰ，Ⅱ期）乳腺癌是否需要辅助化疗则取决于一些预后因素。国际早期乳腺癌权威会议St. Gallen会议根据大量临床研究的结果建议：将患者根据淋巴结转移情况、肿瘤大小、肿瘤组织学分级、年龄等因素分为高、中、低危三组，再制定相应的治疗策略。2009年St.Gallen会议共识提出首先要考虑肿瘤对内分泌治疗的反应性，将患者分为内分泌治疗有反应、内分泌治疗无反应、内分泌治疗反应不确定三类；同时按照其他肿瘤生物学指标分为低度危险、中度危险和高度危险。_x000D_\n低度危险的定义：腋淋巴结阴性，并同时具备以下所有特征：原发灶≤2 cm、病理分级1级、未侵犯肿瘤周边脉管、ER或 PR阳性、HER-2基因无过表达或扩增、年龄≥35岁。St.Gallen专家共识定义此类患者可以不化疗，而仅选择内分泌治疗。_x000D_\n中度危险的定义：①腋淋巴结阴性，并至少具备以下特征中的一项： 原发灶＞2 cm、病理分级为2～3级、有肿瘤周边脉管侵犯、HER-2基因过表达或扩增、年龄＜35岁。②1～3个腋窝淋巴结转移且 ER或 PR阳性、HER-2（-）。这类患者是不是需要化疗还没有明确结论，需要临床医师综合疾病特征及患者自身情况考虑。_x000D_\n高度危险的定义：①1～3个腋窝淋巴结转移，ER或PR阴性，或HER-2（+）；②＞3个腋窝淋巴结转移。这类患者已经明确需要接受化疗。_x000D_\n部分激素反应性中危患者（如绝经后、仅有一个危险因素的中危患者），也可以不化疗，而仅选择内分泌治疗。_x000D_\n在乳腺癌中有一种非常特殊的类型，肿瘤特征为雌激素受体（ER）、孕激素受体（PR）、HER2基因的表达均为阴性，即所谓的“三阴性”乳腺癌，其预后不佳、局部复发和远处转移风险均较高。因为治疗靶点的缺失，这类患者无法进行内分泌治疗和靶向治疗，故化疗成为了“三阴性”乳腺癌最重要的治疗手段。由于针对这种特殊类型的乳腺癌的临床研究尚不是非常充分，对于这种乳腺癌早期患者的化疗选择也只能采用和其他类型乳腺癌同样的标准，即除了部分低危组的患者外，其他的“三阴性”乳腺癌患者均需要进行术后辅助化疗。_x000D_\n由于早期乳腺癌辅助化疗的研究主要集中于70岁以下的患者，对于年龄大于70岁的患者很难给出一个确定的结论，除了根据危险分级对其进行评估以决定是否进行化疗以外，必须考虑患者的整体健康状况、基础疾病、预期寿命及化疗后毒副反应等因素，从而对化疗带来的益处和风险作出综合判断，再确定是否选择辅助化疗以及选用哪种方案。"}
